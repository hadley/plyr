Package: plyr
Version: 1.8.1.9000
Title: Tools for Splitting, Applying and Combining Data
Description: A set of tools that solves a common set of problems: you
    need to break a big problem down into manageable pieces, operate on each
    piece and then put all the pieces back together.  For example, you might
    want to fit a model to each spatial location or time point in your study,
    summarise data by panels or collapse high-dimensional arrays to simpler
    summary statistics. The development of plyr has been generously supported
    by BD (Becton Dickinson).
