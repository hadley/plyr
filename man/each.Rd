\usage{
each(...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{...}{functions to combine. each function should
  produce a single number as output}
}
\description{
Combine multiple functions into a single function returning
a named vector of outputs. Note: you cannot supply
additional parameters for the summary functions
}
\examples{
# Call min() and max() on the vector 1:10
each(min, max)(1:10)
# This syntax looks a little different.  It is shorthand for the
# the following:
f<- each(min, max)
f(1:10)
# Three equivalent ways to call min() and max() on the vector 1:10
each("min", "max")(1:10)
each(c("min", "max"))(1:10)
each(c(min, max))(1:10)
# Call length(), min() and max() on a random normal vector
each(length, mean, var)(rnorm(100))
