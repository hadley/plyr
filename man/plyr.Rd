\title{plyr: the split-apply-combine paradigm for R.}
\description{
The plyr package is a set of clean and consistent tools
that implement the split-apply-combine pattern in R. This
is an extremely common pattern in data analysis: you solve
a complex problem by breaking it down into small pieces,
doing something to each piece and then combining the
results back together again.
}
\details{
The plyr functions are named according to what sort of data
structure they split up and what sort of data structure
they return:

\describe{ \item{a}{array} \item{l}{list}
\item{d}{data.frame} \item{m}{multiple inputs}
\item{r}{repeat multiple times} \item{_}{nothing} }

So \code{\link{ddply}} takes a data frame as input and
returns a data frame as output, and \code{\link{l_ply}}
takes a list as input and returns nothing as output.
}
\section{Row names}{
  By design, no plyr function will preserve row names - in
  general it is too hard to know what should be done with
  them for many of the operations supported by plyr. If you
  want to preserve row names, use \code{\link{name_rows}}
  to convert them into an explicit column in your data
  frame, perform the plyr operations, and then use
  \code{\link{name_rows}} again to convert the column back
  into row names.
}

\section{Helpers}{
  Plyr also provides a set of helper functions for common
  data analysis problems:

  \itemize{ \item \code{\link{arrange}}: re-order the rows
  of a data frame by specifying the columns to order by
  \item \code{\link{mutate}}: add new columns or modifying
  existing columns, like \code{\link{transform}}, but new
  columns can refer to other columns that you just created.
  \item \code{\link{summarise}}: like \code{\link{mutate}}
  but create a new data frame, not preserving any columns
  in the old data frame.

  \item \code{\link{join}}: an adapation of
  \code{\link{merge}} which is more similar to SQL, and has
  a much faster implementation if you only want to find the
  first match.  \item \code{\link{match_df}}: a version of
  \code{\link{join}} that instead of returning the two
  tables combined together, only returns the rows in the
  first table that match the second.

  \item \code{\link{colwise}}: make any function work
  colwise on a dataframe \item \code{\link{rename}}: easily
  rename columns in a data frame \item
  \code{\link{round_any}}: round a number to any degree of
  precision \item \code{\link{count}}: quickly count unique
  combinations and return return as a data frame. }
