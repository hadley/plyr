\usage{
rbind.fill(...)
}

  \item{...}{input data frames to row bind together.  The
  first argument can be a list of data frames, in which
  case all other arguments are ignored.}
}
\value{
a single data frame
}
\description{
\code{rbind}s a list of data frames filling missing columns
with NA.
}
\details{
This is an enhancement to \code{\link{rbind}} that adds in
columns that are not present in all inputs, accepts a list
of data frames, and operates substantially faster.

Column names and types in the output will appear in the
order in which they were encountered. No checking is
performed to ensure that each column is of consistent type
in the inputs.

rbind.fill(mtcars[c("mpg", "wt")], mtcars[c("wt", "cyl")])
