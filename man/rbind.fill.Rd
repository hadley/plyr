\alias{rbind.fill}
\title{Combine data.frames by row, filling in missing columns.}
\usage{
rbind.fill(...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{...}{input data frames to row bind together.  The
  first argument can be a list of data frames, in which
  case all other arguments are ignored.  Any NULL inputs
  are silently dropped. If all inputs are NULL, the output
  is NULL.}
}
\value{
a single data frame
}
\description{
\code{rbind}s a list of data frames filling missing columns
with NA.
}
\details{
This is an enhancement to \code{\link{rbind}} that adds in
columns that are not present in all inputs, accepts a list
of data frames, and operates substantially faster.

Column names and types in the output will appear in the
order in which they were encountered.

Unordered factor columns will have their levels unified and
character data bound with factors will be converted to
character. POSIXct data will be converted to be in the same
time zone. Array and matrix columns must have identical
dimensions after the row count. Aside from these there are
no general checks that each column is of consistent data
type.
