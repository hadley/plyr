\name{rbind.fill.matrix}
\alias{rbind.fill.matrix}
\title{Bind matrices by row, and fill missing columns with NA.}
\usage{
rbind.fill.matrix(...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{...}{the matrices to rbind. The first argument can
  be a list of matrices, in which case all other arguments
  are ignored.}
}
\value{
a matrix with column names
}
\description{
The matrices are bound together using their column names or
the column indices (in that order of precedence.) Numeric
columns may be converted to character beforehand, e.g.
using format.  If a matrix doesn't have colnames, the
column number is used. Note that this means that a column
with name \code{"1"} is merged with the first column of a
matrix without name and so on. The returned matrix will
always have column names.
}
\details{
Vectors are converted to 1-column matrices.

Matrices of factors are not supported. (They are anyways
quite inconvenient.) You may convert them first to either
numeric or character matrices. If a matrices of different
types are merged, then normal covnersion precendence will
apply.

Row names are ignored.
