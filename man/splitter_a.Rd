\alias{splitter_a}
\title{Split an array by .margins.}
\usage{
splitter_a(data, .margins = 1L, .expand = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{data}{>1d data structure (matrix, data.frame or
  array)}

  \item{.margins}{a vector giving the subscripts to split
  up \code{data} by.}

  \item{.expand}{if splitting a dataframe by row, should
  output be 1d (expand = FALSE), with an element for each
  row; or nd (expand = TRUE), with a dimension for each
  variable.}
}
\value{
a list of lower-d slices, with attributes that record split
details
}
\description{
Split a 2d or higher data structure into lower-d pieces
based
}
\details{
This is the workhorse of the \code{a*ply} functions.  Given
a >1 d data structure (matrix, array, data.frame), it
splits it into pieces based on the subscripts that you
supply.  Each piece is a lower dimensional slice.

The margins are specified in the same way as
\code{\link{apply}}, but \code{splitter_a} just splits up
the data, while \code{apply} also applies a function and
combines the pieces back together.  This function also
includes enough information to recreate the split from
attributes on the list of pieces.
